    Overlapping struct settings found.

    Move these field related settings:
        goverter:map Inputs Outputs

    from the "Convert" method to the "structsInputToStructsOutput" method.

    Goverter won't use "Convert" inside the current conversion method
    and therefore the defined field settings would be ignored.
